# Ludo-Die
A C mini project for Ludo Die.

Created by Qazi Shuaib of SRM IST, in July, 2020.
It was in my local machine, until in Jan 2021, I decided to post it on GitHub.

I was fascinated to solve a household problem of Die ðŸŽ² getting lost.
I decided to make a program for it, to play Ludo.

According to rules of Ludo, the player is given another chance if he scores a 6.
This functionality has been taken care of. 
Whenever the player scores a 6, another number is also generated.
If the second number generated is also 6, then a third number is generated.

I used C library of time to take a unique input.
And used it to process a number between 1 to 6 with the help of srand() and rand() functions.

This project surely helped to me to learn the implementation of basics of C.
Its library functions and time header.
And, also helped me in Logic building.
